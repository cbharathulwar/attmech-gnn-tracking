# **Enhancing Graph Neural Networks for Particle Tracking by Leveraging Attention Mechanisms and Computational Efficiency**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the code and resources used for the research paper **"Enhancing Graph Neural Networks for Particle Tracking by Leveraging Attention Mechanisms and Computational Efficiency"**. The paper introduces improvements to GNN models for particle tracking by enhancing jet tagging accuracy and optimizing computational efficiency. Key contributions include the integration of attention mechanisms, graph sparsification, and the use of automatic mixed precision (AMP).

## **Abstract**
The main focus of this paper is to enhance GNNs for particle tracking at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by improving both jet tagging accuracy and computational efficiency. By incorporating attention mechanisms, the model better captures important node dependencies, while graph sparsification reduces memory consumption. Additionally, AMP optimizes training speed, reducing memory usage without compromising accuracy.
